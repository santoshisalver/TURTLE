# Spiral Pattern with Python Turtle Graphics

## Overview

This project generates a vibrant spiral pattern using Python's Turtle Graphics library.
The pattern is formed by placing randomly colored dots along a spiraling path, creating a dynamic and visually appealing effect.
This program showcases how basic programming concepts like loops, randomization, and drawing functions can be combined to create beautiful visual art with code.

## Features

- *Randomly Colored Spiral*: Each dot in the spiral is randomly colored from a predefined palette.
- *Spiral Effect*: The turtle moves in a spiral, gradually creating an expanding pattern.
- *Simple and Fun*: The program is easy to understand, making it a great introduction to both Python and Turtle Graphics.
- *Customizable*: You can tweak various parameters such as dot distance, colors, and spiral dimensions.

## How It Works

1. *Randomized Colors*: Every time the turtle moves, a random color is chosen from a list of available colors.
2. *Spiral Path*: The turtle's movement follows a spiral, with each turn creating a new layer of dots.
3. *Dot Placement*: Instead of drawing continuous lines, the turtle places individual dots at regular intervals, creating a unique dotted spiral effect.
